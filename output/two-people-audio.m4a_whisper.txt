Hi, my name is Patrick and I'm with Riddhima. Hi Riddhima, say something. Something... Oh sorry, hi, hello. Let's have a meeting tomorrow. Bye. Bye-bye? Already? No, let's stay and talk for a little longer. I like cows. What's your favorite animal? I like, um, cats. She likes cats, guys. Alright, see you later, bye.
